# Foundry

## What is it?
A Rust-based toolkit that's faster and more focused on Solidity-native development

Key Components
- Forge: Testing framework (write test in Solidity)
- Cast: Command line tool for interacting with contracts
- Anvil: Local Ethereum node 
- Chisel: Solidity REPL for quick testing

### Benefits and Cons
It is a faster easier framework to use for fast testing compared to hardhat but its also a newer framework meaning there is less information about it debugging, stack overflow etc good for beginners to understand Rust knowledge is not needed for developing it runs on rust which is why it runs optimized

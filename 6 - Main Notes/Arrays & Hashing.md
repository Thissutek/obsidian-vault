# Arrays & Hashing

## What is it?
Arrays are just collection of elements stored in a contiguous memory and indexed by integers. 

Hashing is storing data in a structure called a hash table. (JS: Map or {} object)
It uses a key -> hash -> index mapping to store values
## Why does it matter?
Arrays super common in programming almost every beginner to medium problem involves using them in some way.

Hash tables let you avoid nested loops by storing seen data
They're essential for problems like two sum, frequency counting, duplicates and grouping problems

## Example

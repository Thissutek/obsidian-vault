## Blockchain
### What is a blockchain?
A blockchain can be seen as a public ledger that everyone can see but no one can cheat
Traditional ISA
Sarah signs a ISA with a school contract is stored in the school cabinets. Only Sarah and the school know about the contract, the school can change the terms without Sarah knowing.

Blockchain ISA
Sarah's ISA is recorded on the blockchain
Everyone can see that "Sarah owes 15% of income for 4 years max 30K to the school"
Sarah's monthly payments are public "Month 1: $750, Month 2: $800"
No one can change the terms not even your platform which creates a trust 
Rules can't be changed and investors know the payments are real

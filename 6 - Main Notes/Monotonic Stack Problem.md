# Monotonic Stack Problem

## What is it?
A Monotonic Stack problem is where you come across a problem that is either always increasing or decreasing. (one way = monotonic)

## Why use it?
It helps solve problems such as 
- Next greater element
- Next smaller element
- Previous greater element
- Previous smaller element

There are problems that would problem would've taken a O(n^2) but using this concept would make it O(n) time complexity because the element is pushed onto or popped off at least once.

## Pattern Recognition
If the problem is asking for greater/smaller/next elements think monotonic stack.

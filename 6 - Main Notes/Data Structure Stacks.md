## Stacks
A Data Structure that kind of reminds me of a queue, its different because its based on the order of operations.

It follows a LIFO principle so imagine like a stack of plates you put at the top and you remove the top plate you never remove anything from the bottom or middle always the top 
### Core Operations for a Stack 
This two are the main operations of the stack
```
pop();
```
- Removes the top element of the stack
```
push()
```
- Adds an element to the top of the stack 

```
Probably used for specific uses cases
peek() or top() gets the value of the top of the stack without removing it 
isEmpty() checks if its empty
```
## Use Cases 
backtracking, undo, Browser History

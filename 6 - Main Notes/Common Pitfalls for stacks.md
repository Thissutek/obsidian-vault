## Common Pitfalls for stacks
Things I didn't know but now i know 
- If you pop on an empty stack -> error or undefined depending on language
- if you mix up stack and queue knowledge you will have you programming knowledge backwards
- you can build a stack from scratch using arrays and linked list

## LLM
Large Language Model

An AI model trained on massive amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language

AI Models Examples
Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, LLaMA

### Core Capabilities
- Natural language understanding: Reads and interprets text.
- Text Generation: Produces coherent, contextually relevant text
- Reasoning: Can follow multi-step logic, summarize, classify plan.
- Adaptability: Can be fine-tuned or prompted for specific tasks.

### How They Work 
1. Training data: Billions of words from books, articles, code, web data
2. Neural network architecture: Usually a Transformer
3. Learning Objectives: Predicts the next word/token given prior context
4. Scale: Larger Models --> stronger reasoning + knowledge

### Limitations 
- **Hallucinations:** May produce incorrect or fabricated answers.
- **No “real” understanding:** Operates on patterns, not human comprehension.
- **Context limits:** Limited memory (context window), though newer models support huge contexts.
- **Bias & safety issues:** Reflects biases in training data.

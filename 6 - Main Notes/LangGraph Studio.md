## LangGraph Studio
This is basically an IDE. Before it was a Desktop application until it was deprecated and now it runs as a local server that you start from the CLI. It's similar to how we start web servers when we need to test web apps. 

Uses the API as its back-end allowing real-time testing and exploration for deployed graphs.

It can be run locally or with cloud deployment.

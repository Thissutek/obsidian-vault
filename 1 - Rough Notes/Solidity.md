# Solidity

## What is it?
Statically typed, object oriented programming language it compiles to bytecode and runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine. Syntax is similar to Javascript and C++ 

## Why does it matter?
Ethereum hosts the largest ecosystem of decentralized applications and has the most developer activity. Learning Solidity gives you access to this massive ecosystem.

Solidity contracts handles billions of dollars in value through DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and other applications. A single smart contract can manage hundreds of millions in assets. 

Many other blockchains Polygon Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche are ethereum compatible which means it can run on those networks with minimal changes. 

#### Developer Workflow
Typically write code in IDEs like Remix (browser-based) or VS code, test contracts using frameworks like Hardhat or Foundry, deploy to testnets like Goerli or Epolia for testing, then finally deploy to mainet after through auditing

### Security Considerations
Solidity contracts are immutable once deployed, making security critical. Common vulnerabilities
[[Reentrancy Attacks]]
[[Integer Overflow/Underflow]]
[[Access Control Issues]]

Best practices include using established libraries like OpenZeppelin, extensive testing and professional audits.

## Smart Contract ISA
#### What are they?
Rule based computer programming that make decisions that are based on the conditions built into them.  These programs are used to verify, control and execute agreements given to them. They are basically if/then functions that will give the payout based on if the conditions are met. 

With smart contracts you are choosing which functions you want to run, and which items you want to obtain. Sometimes with monetary compensation (Gas Fees)

Once the functions are deployed they are immutable and distributed to the blockchain. 

### Mindset Shift
Traditional Deployment: Deploy Now fix bugs later
Smart Contract Deployment: Fix bugs before deployment or lost everything

### Gas optimization
Gas costs add up fast. Poor optimization can make your contract unusable. Every function can cause gas and thats where the money can be bad.

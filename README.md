# 🧠 Jonathan's Zettelkasten Vault

This is my personal knowledge base, built with **Obsidian** and backed by the **Zettelkasten method**. It’s a living system for capturing, organizing, and refining what I learn — especially around programming, problem-solving, and anything worth not forgetting.

> **Backed up with GitHub.** Future-proofed with Markdown.

## 📁 Folder Structure

📁 01 - Rough Notes → Raw ideas, quick captures
📁 02 - Source Material → Collection videos, podcasts, articles etc
📁 03 - Tags → Collection of subject develops into indexes once fully formed connections
📁 04 - Indexes (MOCs) → Maps of Content (entry points to major topics)
📁 05 - Templates → Reusable note blueprints
📁 06 - Main Notes → Fully developed notes

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Capture everything** → Dump into `Rough Notes`  
2. **Process source material** → Summarize in `Main Notes`  
3. **Refine and extract insights** 
4. **Tag + Link notes** → Use `#tags` and `[[wikilinks]]`  
5. **Curate Indexes** → Group connected notes into `Indexes` for fast access

## 🧠 Note Types

### 🏷️ Rough Notes
Messy thoughts. Ideas. Observations. Nothing polished.

### 📚 Source Notes
Notes based on external content. May include quotes, timestamps, and source references.

### 💡 Main Notes
Core ideas written in my own words. These are atomic and link-heavy. They form the backbone of this vault.

### 🗺️ Indexes (MOCs)
High-level topic hubs that group related notes and offer context. These help me navigate the network.
